        <div>A product description is the marketing copy that explains what a product is
             and why it’s worth purchasing. The purpose of a product description is to 
             supply customers with important information about the features and key 
             benefits of the product so they’re compelled to buy.
             A well-crafted product description moves buyers through your conversion funnel. 
             If you add a bit of creativity, your product pages instantly become more 
             compelling, leading to more conversions from casual shoppers. </div></div>
